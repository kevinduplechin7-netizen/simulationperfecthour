Simulation Perfect Hour is a local-first web app for adult language learners. It guides structured, one-hour speaking simulations using a research-backed “Perfect Hour” model. Designed for use with a human helper or guided AI via copy-paste prompts.
Simulation Perfect Hour

Simulation Perfect Hour is a local-first web app for adult language learners who want to improve spoken ability through structured simulation, not casual conversation or chatbots.

The app is built around a single repeatable practice model: the Perfect Hour — a sixty-minute session that balances fluency, input, output, and correction to make speaking improvement predictable.

What this app is (and is not)

This app is:

A simulation system for real-life speaking situations

Designed for adult learners working with a human helper

Research-informed (Paul Nation’s Four Strands, simulation over role-play)

Local-first, private, and offline-friendly

Opinionated by design

This app is not:

A chatbot

A gamified streak app

A role-play / acting app

A replacement for human interaction

The learner is always themselves. Every session practices something they would actually do in real life.

The Perfect Hour (core concept)

Each session follows a fixed structure:

Fluency Repetition — repeat a previous simulation faster and smoother

Meaning-Focused Input — helper models a new situation (Series Method)

Meaning-Focused Output — new simulation with constraints and a twist

Language-Focused Learning — record-for-correction and reflection

This structure removes guesswork, reduces anxiety, and makes improvement measurable.

Partner modes

You choose who you’re working with before each session:

Human Partner (recommended)
Run the session with a tutor, coach, or native speaker. The app provides clear helper instructions so no teaching experience is required.

AI Partner (guided)
Use any external AI tool as a stand-in helper via copy-paste prompts.
No APIs, no keys, no lock-in. The app itself never calls an AI.

The structure and pedagogy remain identical in both modes.

Simulation templates

Sessions are powered by reusable simulation templates that include:

Learner card (goals, steps, phrases)

Helper card (constraints, objections, hidden information)

A built-in twist to force negotiation

A step-by-step session script

Templates can be:

Created manually

Generated with an AI via copy-paste

Imported or exported as JSON

Privacy & storage

Simulation Perfect Hour is local-first:

No accounts

No analytics

No cloud storage

All data is stored locally in your browser and can be backed up manually.

Tech stack

React

TypeScript

Vite

IndexedDB / localStorage

No backend

No external APIs

Philosophy

Speaking improves through designed struggle, not endless chatting.

This app encodes a repeatable ritual that learners can run weekly with confidence — with humans at the center, and AI as an optional tool, not a replacement.

Getting started
npm install
npm run dev


Open the app, choose a partner mode, select a simulation template, and run your first Perfect Hour.
